They looked like crypto trading tools, Google Workspace integrations, and YouTube utilities. They were actually credential-stealing malware targeting macOS and Windows users.
Security researchers found them. Some got removed. As of this week, eight confirmed malicious skills are still live on the platform.
This isn’t a bug. It’s the predictable outcome of giving AI agents full system access with zero security review.

That’s the headline. Here’s what it actually means.

Prompt injection attacks against human-facing chatbots are well-known. But AI-to-AI infection—where one AI system attacks another through data exchange—is the next frontier of cybersecurity. And most OpenClaw deployments are completely vulnerable.
The Threat Model Traditional cybersecurity focuses on protecting systems from human attackers. But in 2026, AI agents are interacting with other AI systems constantly:

This isn’t a demo. This is production. Real customers. Real money. Real stakes.
And because a security breach could kill my business, we had to get security right. This is the full story: why we built it, how it works, what we learned, and how we hardened it.

Process natural language Make decisions Control hardware Communicate over networks Welcome to the edge AI revolution.
What Is PicoClaw? PicoClaw is a minimal AI assistant runtime designed for resource-constrained environments:
Footprint: ~500KB core binary RAM usage: 10-50MB depending on model Hardware: Runs on ESP32, Raspberry Pi Zero, even Arduino with enough memory Model: Quantized small language models (1B-3B parameters) Connectivity: WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, cellular Think of it as OpenClaw’s tiny cousin — sacrificing capabilities for portability.

Normally, we’d chalk this up to coincidence. Cold weather, aging equipment, bad luck. But ZEKE noticed a pattern we didn’t: all three had installed the same model water heater from the same batch in 2020.
We checked the manufacturer’s bulletins. Sure enough: a recall notice had been issued the week before for that exact model and production batch. The control boards were failing prematurely.
