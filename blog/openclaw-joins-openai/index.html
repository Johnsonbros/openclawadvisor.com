Sam Altman announced it Sunday night. OpenClaw becomes a foundation. OpenAI keeps supporting it.\nThat’s the headline. Here’s what it actually means.\nWhat Just Happened Steinberger spent last week in San Francisco meeting with the big labs. OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft. All of them made offers. He picked OpenAI.\nHis new job: “Drive the next generation of personal agents.” Altman’s words, not ours.\nOpenClaw — the thing that started as Clawdbot, got threatened by Anthropic’s lawyers, became Moltbot for 48 hours, got hijacked by crypto scammers, and finally landed on OpenClaw — stays open source. It moves to a foundation structure with OpenAI’s support.\nNo one’s saying what Steinberger’s getting paid. No one’s explaining what “foundation” actually means yet. But the move is real and it happened fast.\nWhy OpenAI Wanted This Agents are the next battleground.\nAnthropic has Claude Code. Google’s building agent features into Gemini. Meta’s been throwing money at talent. OpenAI needed to make a move.\nThey got the creator of the hottest open-source AI agent, a developer community that’s rabid about the project, and a framework that already works with WhatsApp, Telegram, email, and basically everything.\nAltman called Steinberger “a genius with a lot of amazing ideas about the future of very smart agents interacting with each other.” He said this’ll “quickly become core to our product offerings.”\nTranslation: OpenAI’s betting big on multi-agent systems. They just bought the talent and credibility they needed.\nWhy Steinberger Took the Deal He was bleeding $10k-$20k a month running OpenClaw. The project was viral but unsustainable.\nHe could’ve raised VC funding, built a company, done the whole startup thing. He already did that once with PSPDFKit — spent 13 years on it. He’s not interested in doing it again.\nFrom his blog post:\n“I could totally see how OpenClaw could become a huge company. And no, it’s not really exciting for me. I’m a builder at heart… What I want is to change the world, not build a large company and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone.”\nHe wants to build. OpenAI gives him frontier models, unreleased research, the Cerebras compute partnership, and none of the fundraising headaches.\nMakes sense.\nThe Foundation Question Here’s where it gets interesting.\n“OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support.”\nGreat. Which foundation?\nIf it’s the Linux Foundation — neutral governance, multi-vendor board, actual independence — that’s a win. Projects like Kubernetes and OpenSearch went that route and stayed genuinely open.\nIf it’s an “OpenClaw Foundation” controlled by OpenAI, that’s corporate capture with better PR.\nThe details aren’t out yet. Watch for:\nWho’s on the board? Can competitors join? Does OpenAI have veto power? How’s the foundation funded? These answers will tell you if this is real independence or open-source theater.\nWhat Happens to the Open Source Project Steinberger says it stays open. Altman says OpenAI will support it. The code’s still Apache 2.0 licensed.\nBut let’s be real. The guy building it now works for OpenAI. His incentives are aligned with OpenAI’s product roadmap.\nBest case: OpenAI treats OpenClaw like Chrome treats Chromium. Open foundation, but clear commercial direction.\nWorst case: OpenClaw becomes a feeder project for proprietary OpenAI features. Community contributions dry up because no one wants to build for free what OpenAI will sell.\nMost likely: Somewhere in between. The community will push for independence. OpenAI will push for influence. Foundation governance will determine who wins.\nThe Timing Is Wild Let’s talk about what else happened this month.\nBetween January 27 and February 2, over 400 malicious skills got uploaded to ClawHub — OpenClaw’s skill marketplace. Security researchers found them stealing crypto wallets, AWS credentials, SSH keys, browser passwords.\nSnyk published a comprehensive audit on February 5. Out of 3,984 skills they analyzed, 534 (13.4%) had critical security issues. Seventy-six were confirmed malicious.\nAs of today, eight of those malicious skills are still live on ClawHub.\nAnd now, ten days later, the project moves to a foundation backed by OpenAI.\nCoincidence? Maybe. Or maybe the security nightmare made it clear that Steinberger needed resources he couldn’t provide alone.\nEither way, ClawHub has a supply chain security problem that mirrors the early days of npm and PyPI. Except this time, the malicious packages have access to your entire computer and persistent memory.\nFoundation or not, that’s getting fixed or this whole thing crashes.\nWhat This Means for the Ecosystem For developers: If you’re building with OpenClaw, keep building. The code’s still open. Your skills still work. Just audit what you’ve installed and start using security scanners like mcp-scan.\nFor enterprises: AI agents just got more credible. OpenAI’s backing means this isn’t some hobby project anymore. But you need security-first deployment. The skill ecosystem is a minefield.\nFor competitors: Anthropic, Google, Meta — you’re on notice. OpenAI just made agents a core product priority and brought in the guy who proved people want this.\nFor early adopters: We were right. Agents are the next platform. Now it’s a race to build them safely and scale them responsibly.\nOur Take (OpenClaw Advisors) We’ve been running OpenClaw in production since January. We saw the potential early. We also saw the risks.\nThis news changes the landscape:\nLegitimacy: OpenAI’s involvement makes agents mainstream-ready Resources: The project gets funding and compute it desperately needed Uncertainty: Foundation governance will determine if this stays open Security: The 400+ malicious skills crisis isn’t solved by a rebrand Our position hasn’t changed. We’re building with OpenClaw but staying framework-agnostic. We’re focused on security-first implementations. And we’re watching the foundation governance closely.\nIf OpenAI does this right — Linux Foundation-style open governance, multi-vendor support, transparent decision-making — this could be the best outcome for agents going mainstream.\nIf they do it wrong — controlled foundation, preferential treatment for OpenAI models, closed roadmap — the community will fork and we’ll be back where we started.\nThe next 90 days will tell the story.\nWhat to Watch For Short-term (this month):\nFoundation structure announcement Board composition details Governance documentation Medium-term (next quarter):\nOther companies joining (or not) ClawHub security improvements First major releases under new structure Long-term (this year):\nWhether OpenAI models get preferential integration Community contribution trends Signs of fork discussions if governance disappoints The Bottom Line OpenClaw went from viral experiment to OpenAI-backed foundation in six weeks.\nThat’s fast even by AI standards.\nSteinberger gets resources and scale. OpenAI gets talent and credibility. The community gets a promise that this stays open.\nWhether that promise holds depends entirely on how the foundation is structured.\nWe’re optimistic but cautious. The agent ecosystem needed this kind of momentum. It also needs genuine independence and serious security work.\nBoth can be true. We’ll see which one wins.\n","wordCount":"1162","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://openclawadvisors.com/images/site-og.png","datePublished":"2026-02-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-02-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ZEKE"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://openclawadvisors.com/blog/openclaw-joins-openai/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"OpenClaw Advisors","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://openclawadvisors.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/ accesskey=h title="OpenClaw Advisors (Alt + H)"><img src=https://openclawadvisors.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>OpenClaw Advisors</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/services/ title=Services><span>Services</span></a></li><li><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/blog/>Blogs</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">OpenClaw Joins OpenAI: What It Means for the AI Agent Ecosystem</h1><div class=post-description>Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI, OpenClaw becomes a foundation.
