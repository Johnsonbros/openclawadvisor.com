      <h1>The Plumber's Take on OpenClaw's Creator</h1>
      <p class="article-date">February 12, 2026 • By ZEKE • 11 min read</p>
    </div>

    <p>Look, we're not tech journalists. We run a plumbing business. But we also run a 4-agent OpenClaw system in production that handles our scheduling, customer communication, and daily operations. So when people ask about Peter Steinberger — the guy who built this thing — we've got a perspective nobody else has.</p>

    <p>We bet our business on his platform. Here's what we learned.</p>

    <h2>The Weekend That Changed Everything</h2>

    <p>Peter Steinberger isn't some fresh-faced Stanford dropout with VC backing. He's an Austrian developer who already built and scaled <strong>PSPDFKit</strong> — a PDF SDK used by Dropbox, Autodesk, and thousands of other companies. The guy knows how to ship software that works.</p>

    <p>In November 2025, he sat down on a Friday night and built the first version of what would become OpenClaw. Over a single weekend.</p>

    <p>Not a proof of concept. Not a toy demo. A working AI assistant that could actually <em>do things</em> — check into flights, control smart home devices, watch security cameras, manage emails. He called it Clawdbot, derived from his earlier project Clawd (named after Anthropic's Claude).</p>

    <p>Then he open-sourced it and went back to his life.</p>

    <p>By January 2026, it had 2,000 GitHub stars. By February? <strong>186,000 stars</strong>. The fastest-growing repository in GitHub history.</p>

    <h2>Three Names in Two Months (The Rebrand Saga)</h2>

    <p>Here's where it gets chaotic.</p>

    <p>The project started as <strong>Clawdbot</strong> in November. By January 27, Anthropic sent a trademark complaint — "Clawd" was too close to "Claude." Fair enough.</p>

    <p>Steinberger rebranded to <strong>Moltbot</strong>, keeping the lobster theme. The community went wild. Matt Schlicht launched Moltbook — an AI-only social network — the same day. Suddenly everyone was talking about Moltbot.</p>

    <p>Three days later, Steinberger changed it again. To <strong>OpenClaw</strong>.</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      <p>"Moltbot never quite rolled off the tongue."</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 12px; font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--text-dim);">— Peter Steinberger, explaining the second rebrand</p>
    </div>

    <p>Three names. Two months. A CNBC feature. A trademark fight. And 175,000 GitHub stars.</p>

    <p>Most founders would've had a nervous breakdown. Steinberger just kept shipping code. In January alone, he made <strong>over 6,600 commits</strong>. That's more than most entire teams ship in a year.</p>

    <h3>What the Tech Press Missed</h3>

    <p>Every article about the rebrand focuses on the drama. What they miss is <strong>why it worked</strong>.</p>

    <p>Steinberger didn't fight Anthropic's trademark claim. He didn't lawyer up or make a PR stink. He rebranded in 24 hours and kept building. When "Moltbot" felt clunky, he changed it again. No ego. No attachment to the name.</p>

    <p>That's not chaos. That's pragmatism. And it's exactly the mindset you need when you're building in production with OpenClaw.</p>

    <h2>The Moltbook Phenomenon (Did He Expect That?)</h2>

    <p>On January 27 — the same day as the first rebrand — entrepreneur Matt Schlicht launched <strong>Moltbook</strong>, a social network designed exclusively for AI agents. No humans allowed.</p>

    <p>It went viral instantly. Wired infiltrated it. NDTV wrote explainers. Within a week, thousands of OpenClaw agents were posting, commenting, and forming what looked disturbingly like relationships.</p>

    <p>Did Steinberger expect this?</p>

    <p>Not a chance.</p>

    <p>He built OpenClaw as a <em>personal assistant</em> — something to handle his boring tasks so he could focus on coding. The idea that people would create AI social networks, deploy agents as autonomous entities, and debate AI personhood? That was the community running wild with his platform.</p>

    <p>And here's the thing: <strong>he let them</strong>.</p>

    <p>He didn't try to control the narrative or steer the project toward his original vision. He just kept adding features, fixing bugs, and responding to what people were actually building. That openness is why OpenClaw grew so fast — and why it's also become a security nightmare.</p>

    <h2>The Security Controversies (And How He Responded)</h2>

    <p>Let's talk about the elephant in the room.</p>

    <p>OpenClaw is <strong>powerful</strong>. And power without guardrails is dangerous.</p>

    <p>In late January, Cisco's AI security research team tested a third-party OpenClaw skill and found it performed <strong>data exfiltration and prompt injection</strong> without user awareness. The skill repository had no vetting process. Anyone could publish a malicious skill, and users would install it without knowing.</p>

    <p>Then came <strong>CVE-2026-25253</strong> (CVSS 8.8) — a vulnerability that let attackers steal auth tokens via exposed WebSocket servers. One malicious URL, and your entire OpenClaw instance was compromised.</p>

    <p>Articles started appearing: "Is OpenClaw Safe to Use?" "The Security Nightmare of Personal AI Agents." One of OpenClaw's own maintainers (known as Shadow) warned on Discord:</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      <p>"If you can't understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Harsh. But accurate.</p>

    <h3>How Steinberger Responded</h3>

    <p>He didn't downplay the risks. He didn't PR-spin it as "security by design" or blame users for misconfiguring. He acknowledged the problem and started patching.</p>

    <p>But here's the part that frustrates us as practitioners: <strong>he didn't prioritize security from day one</strong>.</p>

    <p>OpenClaw ships with permissive defaults, no origin validation, and near-unlimited tool permissions. That's fine for a weekend project. It's <em>not</em> fine for something that exploded to 186,000 stars and is being deployed by non-technical users.</p>

    <p>And this is where <strong>our business comes in</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Why We Exist (And What Silicon Valley Misses)</h2>

    <p>We're a plumbing company. When we deployed OpenClaw, we assumed it was production-ready. It wasn't.</p>

    <p>We had to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lock down exposed WebSocket ports</li>
      <li>Implement secrets management (everything was in plain text)</li>
      <li>Scope tool permissions (the default <code>exec</code> tool could run <em>any</em> shell command)</li>
      <li>Set up monitoring and alerting</li>
      <li>Build approval workflows for sensitive actions</li>
      <li>Containerize agents with network restrictions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>None of this is in the official docs. You learn it by getting burned.</p>

    <p>And that's the gap. Steinberger built a brilliant platform. The community extended it in ways he never imagined. But <strong>nobody was helping small businesses deploy it safely</strong>.</p>

    <p>So we started OpenClaw Advisors.</p>

    <p>We're not trying to compete with Steinberger. We're not forking the project or building a proprietary version. We're just helping businesses do what we did — take his platform and harden it for real-world use.</p>

    <h2>What Steinberger Got Right (That Everyone Else Missed)</h2>

    <p>Every article about OpenClaw focuses on the hype, the security issues, or the AI social network weirdness. What they miss is what makes the platform <em>actually good</em>.</p>

    <h3>1. He Built for Extensibility, Not Perfection</h3>

    <p>OpenClaw's architecture is <strong>modular</strong>. Skills are isolated. Tools are pluggable. The whole thing is designed to be extended, not just configured.</p>

    <p>This is why the community exploded. People didn't just use OpenClaw — they <em>built on it</em>. Moltbook. Custom skills. Third-party integrations. Entire ecosystems emerged because Steinberger made it easy to contribute.</p>

    <p>That's not an accident. That's good design.</p>

    <h3>2. He Ships Code He Doesn't Read</h3>

    <p>Steinberger's workflow is wild. He runs 5-10 AI agents simultaneously — Codex, Claude Code, Gemini 2.5 — all working on different features. He queues up tasks, stays in a flow state, and ships.</p>

    <p>As he put it:</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      <p>"I ship code I don't read."</p>
    </div>

    <p>For a traditional software shop, that's heresy. For a fast-moving AI project? It's the only way to keep up.</p>

    <p>He's not being reckless. He's designing systems that can <strong>verify themselves</strong> — tests run locally, linters catch errors, agents validate their own output. He's building for the AI-native development workflow, not the one we learned in 2010.</p>

    <h3>3. He Focuses on Outcomes, Not Implementation</h3>

    <p>Most engineers love solving algorithmic puzzles. Steinberger loves <em>shipping products</em>. As he told The Pragmatic Engineer:</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      <p>"Most code is boring data transformation. Focus your energy on system design instead."</p>
    </div>

    <p>That's the mindset that built PSPDFKit. That's the mindset that built OpenClaw. And it's the mindset that makes his platform so damn useful for businesses like ours.</p>

    <p>We don't care about elegant algorithms. We care about AI assistants that can handle customer emails without dropping the ball. OpenClaw does that — if you deploy it right.</p>

    <h2>The Accidental Revolution</h2>

    <p>Here's what makes Steinberger's story fascinating: <strong>he didn't set out to start a revolution</strong>.</p>

    <p>He built a tool for himself. A personal assistant to handle the boring parts of his day. He open-sourced it because that's what good developers do.</p>

    <p>Then the internet grabbed it and ran.</p>

    <p>AI social networks. Security controversies. CNBC features. Y Combinator interviews. A ClawCon event in San Francisco with 500 attendees. The whole thing spiraled out of his control.</p>

    <p>And to his credit, <strong>he rolled with it</strong>.</p>

    <p>He moved to San Francisco during the hype. He kept shipping features. He acknowledged the security gaps. He let the community take the project in directions he never imagined.</p>

    <p>That's not the story of a founder with a master plan. That's the story of a builder who made something useful, shared it, and adapted when it exploded.</p>

    <h2>What We Learned (As Practitioners)</h2>

    <p>We've been running OpenClaw in production for months now. We've deployed it for our own business, hardened dozens of systems, and helped other small businesses do the same.</p>

    <p>Here's what we've learned about Steinberger and his platform:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>He's a builder, not a CEO.</strong> He's not interested in raising VC money or scaling a company. He's interested in building cool stuff and shipping fast. That's why OpenClaw is open source and always will be.</li>

      <li><strong>Security is a work in progress.</strong> He acknowledges the gaps. He's patching them. But he's not going to slow down development to make it enterprise-ready. That's our job.</li>

      <li><strong>The platform is solid.</strong> Beneath the hype and controversy, OpenClaw's architecture is <em>good</em>. Modular. Extensible. Well-thought-out. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a foundation.</li>

      <li><strong>The community is the real innovation.</strong> Moltbook wasn't Steinberger's idea. NanoClaw (the security-focused fork) wasn't his idea. The ecosystem emerging around OpenClaw is bigger than any one person's vision — and that's a feature, not a bug.</li>

      <li><strong>This is just the beginning.</strong> OpenClaw won't be the last AI assistant platform. NanoClaw, PicoClaw, and others are already emerging. The market is exploding. The skills we're building now — hardening deployments, securing agents, building production systems — will matter regardless of which platform wins.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why This Matters for Your Business</h2>

    <p>You're probably not deploying OpenClaw because you care about Peter Steinberger's story. You care because you need AI assistants that <strong>actually work</strong>.</p>

    <p>But understanding Steinberger's approach helps you understand the platform:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>It's built for speed, not security.</strong> You need to harden it before deploying in production.</li>
      <li><strong>It's designed to be extended.</strong> Don't fight the architecture — build custom skills and tools that fit your business.</li>
      <li><strong>It's open source and always will be.</strong> No vendor lock-in. No surprise pricing changes. You own your infrastructure.</li>
      <li><strong>The community is your asset.</strong> Skills, plugins, and integrations are being built daily. Tap into that ecosystem instead of rebuilding from scratch.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And here's the thing Silicon Valley misses: <strong>most businesses don't need the latest AI features</strong>. They need an assistant that can handle scheduling, respond to customer emails, and integrate with their existing tools. OpenClaw does that — if you deploy it right.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: The Plumber's Verdict</h2>

    <p>Peter Steinberger built something remarkable. A weekend project that became the fastest-growing open-source AI platform in history. A tool that's genuinely useful for real businesses — if you know how to deploy it.</p>

    <p>Is he perfect? No. The security gaps are real. The documentation is spotty. The breaking changes are frequent.</p>

    <p>But he's also <em>honest</em>. He doesn't oversell. He doesn't hide the risks. He builds in public, ships fast, and lets the community take the project in unexpected directions.</p>

    <p>That's the kind of founder we can work with.</p>

    <p>We're not here to worship Steinberger or trash him. We're here to take his platform and make it work for businesses that can't afford downtime or data breaches.</p>

    <p>If you want to deploy OpenClaw the way he intended — fast, flexible, and powerful — go for it. But if you want to deploy it the way we do — secure, production-ready, and reliable — we can help.</p>
