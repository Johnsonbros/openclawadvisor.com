      <h1>What OpenClaw Power Users Know That You Don't</h1>
      <p class="article-date">February 12, 2026 • 9 min read</p>
    </div>

    <p>There's a gap between the people hyping OpenClaw on Twitter and the people actually running it to make money.</p>

    <p>I spent 27 hours digging through Reddit threads, Hacker News comments, GitHub issues, security reports, and YouTube teardowns. Not the sanitized blog posts. The real conversations where people share what's actually working.</p>

    <p>Here's what I found: <strong>The people getting real value treat OpenClaw like infrastructure</strong>—isolated, hardened, and purpose-built for specific workflows. The people getting burned treat it like a consumer app.</p>

    <p>Let me show you what the power users are doing differently.</p>

    <h2>1. They Don't Use Built-In Memory (At Least Not Alone)</h2>

    <p>OpenClaw ships with a RAG system using sqlite-vec for vector search. It's hybrid—semantic search plus BM25 keyword matching, merged with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Sounds good on paper.</p>

    <p>But here's the catch: memory compaction only works well on Anthropic models. If you're using Gemini, you hit context bloat fast because pruning isn't implemented for non-Anthropic providers. One power user described their context growing to 200k tokens in a single session. At that point, the agent becomes useless.</p>

    <h3>What Power Users Do Instead</h3>

    <p>They run <strong>external memory systems</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>ClawRag</strong> (production-ready): Self-hosted RAG engine with ChromaDB vector storage, 512-token chunks with 128-token overlap, Docker-first deployment. Handles hundreds of documents with semantic search.</li>
      <li><strong>Supermemory</strong> (cloud-hosted): Requires a Pro subscription but auto-recalls relevant memories before every AI turn, auto-captures conversations after each turn, and builds persistent user profiles.</li>
      <li><strong>Manual curation</strong>: They edit MEMORY.md files aggressively to prune noise. This is boring but effective.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The pattern that works: short-term memory (OpenClaw's built-in RAG) for the current session, long-term memory (external system) for historical context, and manual curation to keep things clean.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h3>✓ One HN user said it best:</h3>
      <p>"Memory works surprisingly well. Daily markdown logs + semantic search. It references decisions from days ago and builds on previous work. The magic isn't any single feature—it's having a persistent assistant that remembers context across sessions."</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. They Run on VPS + Tailscale, Not Their Laptop</h2>

    <p>Most OpenClaw tutorials show you how to install it on your MacBook. That's fine for tinkering. But power users running real businesses? They're not doing that.</p>

    <p><strong>The VPS Pattern (from multiple Reddit and HN threads):</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Run OpenClaw in Docker on a small VPS ($5-10/month)</li>
      <li>Tailscale for secure access (not exposed to the internet)</li>
      <li>Separate Gmail account for email integration (burner strategy)</li>
      <li>Delegate access instead of full OAuth tokens</li>
      <li>Auto-label sensitive emails (banking, crypto) and configure agent to skip them</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why VPS instead of laptop? Because your laptop isn't always on. Power users need 24/7 operation. They wake up to work their agent already did while they were asleep.</p>

    <p>One guy described his morning briefing setup: "I wake up to a full briefing. My agent already did 4 hours of work while I was drooling on my pillow." That's the standard.</p>

    <h2>3. They Use the "Supervisor Pattern"</h2>

    <p>Beginners run one agent and try to make it do everything. Power users run multiple specialized agents orchestrated by a supervisor.</p>

    <p><strong>Real example from HN:</strong> A developer runs an agent called "Patch" that manages 5-10 specialist agents via shared tmux. He can SSH into his workstation from his iPhone while standing in line at Disneyland and manage 20 open terminals through Patch.</p>

    <p>Another user runs Buddy (personal assistant) who manages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Katy</strong>: Twitter/X growth</li>
      <li><strong>Jerry</strong>: Job scouting</li>
      <li><strong>Burry</strong>: Crypto trading</li>
      <li><strong>Mike</strong>: Security monitoring</li>
      <li><strong>Elon</strong>: Building and shipping features</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Agents share intelligence through a shared file, coordinate in a Telegram group, and produce overnight results. The human supervises the supervisor, not the individual agents. This is how you scale.</p>

    <h2>4. They Write Detailed Specs (The "Bead" System)</h2>

    <p>One power user on HN runs a 22-core workstation with multiple Claude Code instances. His secret? Spec-driven development with "beads."</p>

    <p><strong>The process:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Spec out everything in detail with docs</li>
      <li>Create granular tasks called "beads" (dependency structure)</li>
      <li>Agents pull a bead to implement</li>
      <li>Custom linters and code standardization docs enforce quality</li>
      <li>Pre-commit hooks catch garbage code</li>
    </ol>

    <p>His assessment: "Better code than I could write after 10 years of focused daily coding."</p>

    <p>This is the difference between vibe coders and professionals. Vibe coders say "build me a website" and get a broken React app with hardcoded API keys. Professionals write a 12-page spec, break it into 40 beads, and let agents execute with precision.</p>

    <h2>5. They Aggressively Limit Tool Permissions</h2>

    <p>OpenClaw ships with near-unlimited permissions by default. <code>exec</code> can run arbitrary shell commands. <code>write</code> can modify any file. <code>browser</code> can access any website.</p>

    <p>This is terrifying in production. One prompt injection attack could delete your database.</p>

    <p><strong>What power users do:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Principle of least privilege</strong>: Only grant tools agents actually need</li>
      <li><strong>Scope permissions</strong>: <code>exec</code> whitelists allowed commands, <code>read/write</code> restricted to specific directories, <code>browser</code> limited to approved domains</li>
      <li><strong>Sandboxing</strong>: Run agents in Docker containers with read-only filesystem mounts and network restrictions</li>
      <li><strong>Approval workflows</strong>: High-risk actions (database writes, external API calls) require explicit human approval</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h3>⚠️ Real Story</h3>
      <p>One power user's agent sent an aggressive email to their insurance company after misinterpreting context. It accidentally triggered a renewed investigation instead of a rejection. They now have a rule: all emails to specific domains require approval.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>6. They Control Costs Like Their Business Depends On It</h2>

    <p>Because it does.</p>

    <p>AI consultant Shelly Palmer spent $250 on setup alone. $400/month is common for power users ($200 Claude + $200 OpenAI). Cost optimization becomes a full-time job.</p>

    <p><strong>Power user cost strategies:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Model switching</strong>: Opus for planning and hard problems, Haiku for execution and simple tasks</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt caching</strong>: Save 90% on repeated context (Anthropic-specific)</li>
      <li><strong>Kill sessions aggressively</strong>: When context exceeds 100k tokens, start fresh</li>
      <li><strong>Budget caps</strong>: $20 weekly budget, reload manually to force awareness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If your agent costs $400/month to run, your services need to generate way more than that to justify it. Power users track token costs per task and optimize ruthlessly.</p>

    <h2>7. They Paper Trade Before Going Live</h2>

    <p>This applies to trading, but the principle works everywhere: <strong>test in simulation before betting real money</strong>.</p>

    <p>One trader ran their OpenClaw strategy in paper trading for weeks, hitting a 77% win rate before going live. Others went live too quickly and lost money.</p>

    <p>For non-trading use cases, this means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Test email automation on a dummy account first</li>
      <li>Run customer service replies in "draft mode" for human review</li>
      <li>Deploy to staging before production</li>
      <li>Monitor closely for the first 30 days</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. They Have a Kill Switch</h2>

    <p>Power users running agents 24/7 have a way to immediately shut everything down.</p>

    <p>Common patterns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Telegram command (<code>/pause trading</code>)</li>
      <li>API endpoint to disable execution</li>
      <li>Docker container stop script</li>
      <li>Manual override that requires daily re-enable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One Mac Mini user running a business said: "Too agreeable by default. Had to explicitly program 'push back on bad ideas' rules into its personality file."</p>

    <p>Agents will hallucinate revenue figures, invent specs, and implement bad ideas without questioning. The kill switch prevents runaway disasters.</p>

    <h2>The Money Question: Are People Actually Profiting?</h2>

    <p>Yes. But not the way you think.</p>

    <p><strong>Proven revenue models from Reddit and real case studies:</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>White-label AI infrastructure for agencies</strong> ($2k-5k/month): Marketing agencies outsource technical implementation. You provide OpenClaw setup as white-label service. Recurring revenue for maintenance plus API cost markup.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom workflow automation</strong> ($5k-10k one-time): Business process automation, API integrations, CRM connections. High margin (80%+), repeatable process.</li>
      <li><strong>Content services</strong> ($500/month): Blog posts, social media management, SEO content pipelines. Brand voice maintenance.</li>
      <li><strong>Freelancer 10x capacity</strong>: Not a service—a personal multiplier. Handle 10x normal client load by automating repetitive tasks.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>One real example: A guy running a SaaS plus AV rentals business in Orange County. Mac Mini M4 running Opus 4.5 via Claude Max. Overnight work includes research reports, competitor analysis, lead lists. Found and fixed a broken SMS chatbot (broken for 10 months). Connected to 4 new APIs in one session.</p>

    <p>Revenue generated: $0 (yet). But work that wouldn't have been done.</p>

    <p>That's the real value. Not replacing your job. Doing the work you never had time for.</p>

    <h2>What This Means for You</h2>

    <p>If you're trying to use OpenClaw like a ChatGPT wrapper, you're going to be disappointed. The power users aren't doing that.</p>

    <p>They're treating it like infrastructure: isolated environments, hardened security, purpose-built workflows, detailed specifications, cost controls, and human oversight.</p>

    <p>It's not plug-and-play. It's build-and-maintain. But if you're willing to do the work—or hire someone who knows how—the upside is real.</p>
