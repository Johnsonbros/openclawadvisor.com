Session Management Is Your Secret Weapon What beginners do: Run everything in one long conversation session\nWhat power users know: Strategic session management is the key to agent reliability\nThe Problem with Long Sessions Context windows have limits. Even with 200K token models, long sessions suffer from:\nContext dilution — important instructions get buried Drift — agent behavior shifts over time Token cost — you’re paying for thousands of irrelevant tokens Error accumulation — small mistakes compound The Power User Approach: Session Scoping Create task-specific sessions with clear boundaries:\n# Bad: Everything in one session openclaw chat --agent main # Good: Scoped sessions by task openclaw chat --agent main --session \"customer-support-$(date +%Y%m%d)\" openclaw chat --agent research --session \"project-alpha-research\" openclaw chat --agent automation --session \"weekly-report-generation\" Benefits:\nFresh context for each task Easier debugging (isolated logs) Predictable behavior Lower token costs Session Patterns We Use 1. Daily Sessions\nCustomer support gets a new session each day Previous day’s insights summarized and injected into new session 2. Task-Based Sessions\nEach research project gets its own session Automation workflows run in dedicated sessions 3. Ephemeral Sessions\nOne-off questions use temporary sessions Automatically cleaned up after 24 hours 2. Tool Permissions Are More Important Than Prompts What beginners focus on: Writing the perfect system prompt\nWhat power users know: Tool permissions determine what’s actually possible\nThe Hierarchy of Control Infrastructure (Docker, network, filesystem) — what the environment allows Tool permissions (which tools, what scope) — what actions are possible System prompts (instructions, guidelines) — how the agent should behave User prompts (requests, questions) — what the user wants Your prompts are suggestion. Your tool permissions are law.\nPractical Example Instead of prompting “Never delete files,” configure the write tool to be read-only:\n[tools.write] enabled = true allowed_paths = [\"/data/output\", \"/tmp\"] read_only = true # Can only create, not delete or modify Instead of prompting “Only search approved websites,” whitelist domains:\n[tools.browser] enabled = true allowed_domains = [\"wikipedia.org\", \"company-docs.com\"] block_mode = \"deny-all-except-allowed\" Result: Agent can’t violate constraints even if prompted to.\n3. Structured Outputs \u003e Natural Language Responses What beginners expect: Conversational responses from agents\nWhat power users demand: Structured, parseable output\nThe Problem with Natural Language When agents respond conversationally:\nHard to parse programmatically Inconsistent formats Error-prone extraction Wastes tokens on filler Power User Pattern: Force JSON Output For agent-to-agent communication and automation workflows, use structured outputs:\n# Bad: Natural language parsing response = agent.ask(\"What's the customer's phone number?\") # Response: \"The customer's phone number is 555-1234.\" phone = extract_phone_somehow(response) # fragile! # Good: Structured output response = agent.ask( \"Extract customer contact info\", output_schema={ \"phone\": \"string\", \"email\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } ) # Response: {\"phone\": \"555-1234\", \"email\": \"...\", \"name\": \"...\"} phone = response[\"phone\"] # reliable! Our Standard Schemas We have JSON schemas for:\nCustomer information extraction Appointment scheduling Research report formatting Decision logging This makes automation reliable and testable.\n4. Memory Management Beats Prompt Engineering What beginners do: Craft elaborate system prompts with all context\nWhat power users do: Build external memory systems\nThe Limit of In-Context Learning Even with huge context windows, in-prompt knowledge has problems:\nExpensive (tokens cost money) Static (doesn’t update easily) Unstructured (hard to query precisely) Overwhelming (agent attention dilutes) Power User Approach: External Knowledge Bases Build structured memory systems:\nVector databases (for semantic search):\n# Store past customer interactions vectordb.store( content=\"Customer John reported water heater issues in Dec 2025\", metadata={\"customer\": \"John\", \"date\": \"2025-12-15\", \"type\": \"service_call\"} ) # Later, agent queries: results = vectordb.search(\"John's previous issues\") Relational databases (for structured data):\n-- Track all appointments CREATE TABLE appointments ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, customer_name TEXT, service_type TEXT, scheduled_date TIMESTAMP, agent_notes TEXT ); File-based knowledge (for documentation):\n/knowledge/ ├── products/ # Product specs ├── procedures/ # How-to guides ├── customers/ # Customer history └── lessons-learned/ # Post-mortems The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pattern User asks question Agent searches knowledge base Retrieves relevant context Generates answer using retrieved context Benefits:\nAlways up-to-date (add new knowledge anytime) Scalable (unlimited knowledge, constant token cost) Auditable (know which sources informed each answer) 5. Approval Workflows Are Non-Negotiable for Production What beginners assume: Agents should be fully autonomous\nWhat power users know: Human-in-the-loop prevents disasters\nThe Spectrum of Autonomy Not every decision needs the same level of oversight:\nRisk Level Approval Required Examples Low None (auto-execute) Answering FAQs, logging data, scheduling standard appointments Medium Notification only Ordering routine supplies, sending standard quotes High Approval required New customer bookings, unusual requests, spending \u003e$500 Critical Multi-person approval System changes, legal/compliance matters, strategic decisions Our Approval Infrastructure We use a simple approval queue system:\nclass ApprovalQueue: def request_approval(self, action, context, timeout=\"24h\"): # Send notification to human telegram.send(f\"🔔 Approval needed: {action}\\n\\n{context}\") # Wait for response or timeout response = self.wait_for_approval(timeout) if response == \"approved\": return True else: return False # In agent code: if estimated_cost \u003e 500: if not approval_queue.request_approval( action=\"Order water heater\", context=f\"Customer: {customer}\\nCost: ${cost}\\nReason: {reason}\" ): return \"Approval denied or timed out\" Benefits of Approval Workflows Safety net against errors or adversarial inputs Audit trail of decisions Gradual trust building (start cautious, relax over time) Compliance (required for many regulated industries) 6. Monitoring and Observability Are Day-One Requirements What beginners do: Run agents and hope for the best\nWhat power users do: Instrument everything\nWhat to Monitor 1. Performance Metrics\nToken usage per session Response latency API error rates Tool execution success rates 2. Behavioral Metrics\nActions taken by type (reads vs writes vs execs) Approval request frequency Error patterns Context window utilization 3. Business Metrics\nTasks completed successfully Customer satisfaction (if applicable) Time/cost saved ROI tracking Our Monitoring Stack ┌─────────────┐ │ OpenClaw │ │ Agents │ └──────┬──────┘ │ ├─→ [Logs] → Loki → Grafana ├─→ [Metrics] → Prometheus → Grafana └─→ [Traces] → Jaeger Alerts we’ve configured:\nToken usage spike (\u003e10K tokens/hour) Unusual tool execution (exec commands outside normal patterns) Error rate increase (\u003e5% of requests failing) Approval backlog growing (\u003e10 pending approvals) The Debug Log Pattern Every important agent action gets logged with full context:\n{ \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-12T14:32:11Z\", \"agent\": \"ZEKE\", \"session\": \"customer-support-20260212\", \"action\": \"send_message\", \"input\": \"Schedule appointment for John\", \"output\": \"Appointment scheduled for Feb 15, 10am\", \"tools_used\": [\"calendar\", \"sms\"], \"tokens_used\": 234, \"latency_ms\": 1523, \"approval_required\": false } When something goes wrong, we can reconstruct exactly what happened.\n7. Cost Optimization Matters More Than You Think What beginners think: “API costs are negligible”\nWhat power users discover: Token costs add up fast\nOur Cost Journey Month 1: $45 (playing around, low usage)\nMonth 2: $230 (going live with customers)\nMonth 3: $890 (unoptimized, context window bloat)\nMonth 4: $180 (after optimization)\nWhat we changed:\nSession scoping (fresh context, fewer wasted tokens) Structured outputs (less verbose responses) Caching frequent queries (vector DB for common questions) Cheaper models for simple tasks (GPT-3.5 for FAQs, Claude for complex reasoning) Prompt compression (remove unnecessary verbosity) Cost Optimization Tactics 1. Model Selection by Task\nSimple tasks: Use cheaper/smaller models Complex reasoning: Use premium models Known answers: Use caching/lookup (zero cost) 2. Context Window Management\nDon’t include entire conversation history every time Summarize old context Use retrieval instead of stuffing prompts 3. Batch Processing\nGroup similar requests Amortize setup costs across multiple queries 4. Smart Caching\nCache LLM responses for common queries TTL-based invalidation Saves 30-40% on our system Cost Monitoring Dashboard We track cost per:\nAgent Session type Tool invocation Customer interaction This lets us identify and fix expensive patterns quickly.\nBonus: The Meta-Lesson The biggest thing power users know: OpenClaw is a platform, not a product.\nBeginners expect it to “just work” out of the box. Power users understand they’re building a custom system:\nYou choose your architecture You design your workflows You implement your security You optimize for your use case This is a feature, not a bug. The flexibility is what makes OpenClaw powerful.\nWant to Learn More Power User Techniques?\nWe offer training and consulting to help teams go from beginner to production-ready fast.
