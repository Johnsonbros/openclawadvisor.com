We’re not a tech company. We fix water heaters, unclog drains, and install toilets. But for the past 18 months, we’ve been running a 4-agent AI system built on OpenClaw that handles scheduling, customer communications, research, and daily operations.\nThis isn’t a demo. This is production. Real customers. Real money. Real stakes.\nAnd because a security breach could kill my business, we had to get security right. This is the full story: why we built it, how it works, what we learned, and how we hardened it.\nProduction Stats 4 AI Agents running 24/7 18 months in production 50+ decisions/day automated 0 security incidents 99.7% uptime Why We Built This In 2024, I hit a wall. My plumbing business was growing, but I couldn’t keep up. I was drowning in:\nCustomer calls and texts at all hours Scheduling conflicts and double-bookings Research questions (“What’s the best tankless water heater for a 3-bath house?”) Administrative work—invoices, follow-ups, ordering parts The obvious answer: hire more people. But that’s expensive, hard to manage, and I’d still be the bottleneck for decisions.\nThen OpenClaw hit my Twitter feed. An AI assistant that could do things—not just answer questions. It could send messages, search the web, run scripts, integrate with tools. I thought: What if I could automate the coordination layer of my business?\nSo I built it. And it worked. Too well, actually—which is when I realized how insecure it was.\nMeet the Team: Our 4 Agents ⚡ ZEKE (Main Operator) Role: Communications, scheduling, daily operations\nWhat ZEKE does:\nHandles incoming customer messages (Telegram, SMS) Triages requests and routes to appropriate agent Manages my calendar and schedules appointments Coordinates with the other 3 agents Makes real-time decisions on pricing and availability Why ZEKE is special: ZEKE has approval authority for routine decisions (booking standard jobs, sending quotes) but escalates edge cases to me. This balance keeps me in control without making me a bottleneck.\n🔍 Huginn (Research Raven) Role: Deep research and analysis\nWhat Huginn does:\nResearches product specifications and vendor options Analyzes customer problems and recommends solutions Investigates new technologies and techniques Compiles reports for me to review Why Huginn matters: Plumbing technology changes fast. Huginn keeps me current without requiring me to read manuals at midnight.\n📝 Muninn (Memory Raven) Role: Documentation and knowledge management\nWhat Muninn does:\nMaintains our knowledge base of past jobs Documents lessons learned and best practices Tracks vendor relationships and parts inventory Searches historical data to answer questions Why Muninn is critical: We’ve been in business 40 years. The tribal knowledge in my head is worth millions. Muninn captures it before I forget.\n🛠️ Oden (Architecture \u0026 Planning) Role: Complex problem-solving and system design\nWhat Oden does:\nHandles multi-step projects requiring coordination Designs solutions for unusual problems Plans workflow improvements Architects new automations Why Oden exists: Some problems don’t fit templates. Oden breaks them down into manageable pieces.\nThe Architecture Our system runs on a dedicated Ubuntu server (Hetzner, $40/month) with these components:\nInfrastructure OpenClaw Gateway (main process) Docker containers for each agent (isolation) PostgreSQL (conversation history and knowledge base) Redis (job queue and caching) Nginx (reverse proxy with SSL) HashiCorp Vault (secret management) Communication Channels Telegram (my primary interface) SMS (customer communications via Twilio) Voice calls (for urgent customer requests) Email (vendor communications) Security Layers Container isolation — each agent runs in its own Docker container Filesystem restrictions — read-only mounts except for specific directories Network segmentation — agents can’t access each other directly Tool permissions — strict whitelisting of allowed commands Approval workflows — high-risk actions require my confirmation Secret rotation — API keys and credentials rotate every 90 days Monitoring and alerts — unusual activity triggers notifications Security Lessons Learned Lesson 1: Default OpenClaw Is Not Production-Ready When I first deployed, I ran OpenClaw with default settings. Within a week, I realized:\nWebSocket ports were exposed to the internet Agents had unlimited filesystem access API keys were in plain text config files No audit logging of agent actions This was terrifying. One prompt injection attack away from disaster.\nLesson 2: Container Isolation Is Non-Negotiable Running all 4 agents in one process meant a compromised agent could access everything. Docker containers with strict mounts solved this.\nEach agent only sees:\nIts own conversation history Approved tool directories Shared read-only knowledge base Lesson 3: Tool Permissions Must Be Explicit OpenClaw’s exec tool can run any shell command by default. We locked it down:\nWhitelist of allowed commands (grep, curl, specific scripts) No shell access (direct execution only) Input sanitization (block injection attempts) Logging of all executions Lesson 4: Human-in-the-Loop for High Stakes We implemented approval workflows for:\nScheduling new customers (in case of spam/fraud) Spending over $500 (ordering expensive parts) System changes (modifying automations) Unusual requests (anything that doesn’t fit patterns) This keeps me in control while automating 90% of routine work.\nWhat This System Handles Daily Operations (Automated) Responding to customer inquiries Scheduling service calls Sending quotes for standard jobs Following up on completed work Ordering routine parts Updating our knowledge base Weekly Operations (Semi-Automated) Reviewing agent decisions for quality Approving unusual requests Planning complex projects Vendor negotiations What I Still Do Myself Final decisions on new customers Complex problem diagnosis On-site service work Strategic business planning Anything involving judgment calls I’m not comfortable delegating The Results Time Saved: 15-20 hours/week on administrative work\nResponse Time: Average 4 minutes (vs. 2 hours before)\nCustomer Satisfaction: Up 34% (faster, more consistent responses)\nRevenue Impact: +22% (can handle more jobs with same team size)\nStress Level: Way down (agents don’t sleep, I do)\nCosts Infrastructure: $40/month (Hetzner server)\nAPI Costs: $120-180/month (Claude API usage)\nDevelopment Time: ~200 hours initial build, ~5 hours/month maintenance\nTotal Monthly Cost: ~$220 (vs. hiring an admin assistant for $3,000+)\nROI: Paid for itself in the first month.\nCommon Questions Q: What if the AI makes a mistake?\nA: Approval workflows prevent catastrophic errors. For routine tasks, we have error budgets. An occasional misscheduled appointment is worth the time saved.\nQ: Do customers know they’re talking to AI?\nA: Yes. Our initial message says: “This is ZEKE, Nate’s AI assistant. I handle scheduling and basic questions. Complex issues go directly to Nate.”\nCustomer feedback: They don’t care as long as they get good service.\nQ: What about the CVE-2026-25253 vulnerability?\nA: We were unaffected because our WebSocket ports weren’t exposed. But it was a wake-up call to stay current on security patches.\nQ: Would this work for other service businesses?\nA: Absolutely. HVAC, electrical, landscaping, cleaning—any business with similar coordination challenges could benefit.\nWant to Build Something Similar?\nWe offer consulting to help service businesses deploy secure AI agent systems. Not a generic chatbot—a real production system tailored to your operations.\nGet a Free Consultation →\n","wordCount":"1130","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://openclawadvisors.com/images/4-agents-production-plumbing-hero.png","datePublished":"2026-02-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-02-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nate Johnson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://openclawadvisors.com/blog/4-agents-production-plumbing/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"OpenClaw Advisors","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://openclawadvisors.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/ accesskey=h title="OpenClaw Advisors (Alt + H)"><img src=https://openclawadvisors.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>OpenClaw Advisors</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/services/ title=Services><span>Services</span></a></li><li><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://openclawadvisors.com/blog/>Blogs</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How We Run 4 AI Agents 24/7 for Our Plumbing Business (Securely)</h1><div class=post-description>Real-world case study: How Johnson Bros Plumbing runs a secure 4-agent OpenClaw system handling scheduling, customer comms, research, and operations.
