Is your OpenClaw deployment secure? Honestly, it's probably not. And that's okay — most aren't. But let's fix that.

OpenClaw is one of the hottest AI projects out there right now. Over a hundred and eighty thousand stars on GitHub, everyone's spinning up their own AI agents. It's exciting. But here's the thing nobody tells you when you first set it up: the defaults are not production ready. Not even close.

I run a four-agent OpenClaw system for a real business. Scheduling, customer communications, research, daily operations — the whole thing. When I first deployed it, I figured the out-of-the-box settings were good enough. They weren't. After a deep security audit — and after studying a real vulnerability that scored an eight point eight out of ten on the severity scale — I found five things that every OpenClaw deployment needs to address. So let's walk through them.

Number one: your ports are probably exposed. By default, OpenClaw runs a WebSocket server that doesn't check where connections are coming from. That means a malicious website could connect to your local instance and steal your authentication token. That's not theoretical — that's exactly how a real vulnerability worked earlier this year. The fix is straightforward. Make sure your config validates where connections originate, bind to localhost only, and never expose your WebSocket port directly to the internet. If you need remote access, use an SSH tunnel.

Number two: your secrets are probably in plain text somewhere. OpenClaw ships with permissive defaults meant for quick prototyping. A lot of people never change them. I've seen production systems with API keys hardcoded in config files, committed to GitHub, and showing up in log files. If someone gets into your system, those keys are gone. The fix: use environment variables, set up a proper secrets manager, and rotate your credentials every ninety days. And for the love of everything, check your Git history — you might have keys in there from months ago that you forgot about.

Number three — and this is the big one — tool permissions. OpenClaw agents can run shell commands, write to any file, browse any website. That's powerful, and it's by design. But in production, it means one prompt injection attack could delete your database or steal customer data. You need to lock this down. Only give agents the tools they actually need. Restrict which commands they can run, which directories they can access, which websites they can visit. Run them in containers if you can. And put approval gates on anything high-risk.

Number four: credential rotation. Even if you're using environment variables — great — but when's the last time you actually changed those keys? Most teams set up OpenClaw once and forget about it. Six months later someone accidentally pushes a key to a public repo. Automate your rotation. Monitor for unusual API usage. And have a plan ready for what to do if a key gets leaked — because it's not if, it's when.

And number five: keep your stuff updated. OpenClaw moves fast. There are frequent updates, and some of them patch serious security holes. That vulnerability I mentioned? It was fixed in a specific version. But how many deployments are still running the old version? Thousands, probably. Subscribe to security announcements, test updates in a staging environment first, and automate your dependency scanning.

Now, I'll be honest — there's a competitor called NanoClaw that's getting a lot of attention specifically because it addresses some of these security issues with container isolation built in from the start. If updating OpenClaw feels risky to you because of breaking changes, that might be worth looking into.

But the bottom line is this: OpenClaw is powerful. It can genuinely transform how a business operates. But power without security is just liability. These five checks are your baseline — the bare minimum. Lock down your ports, secure your secrets, scope your permissions, rotate your credentials, and stay current on patches.

If you're not sure where to start, we do free security assessments. Tell us about your setup and we'll tell you what's vulnerable. That's it. No pressure, no sales pitch. Just a report you can act on.
